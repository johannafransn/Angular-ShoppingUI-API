# Angular Shopping UI

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.8.
It is a simple shopping UI where users can browse products that are all taken from an API. Users can search products by name, and view details where (if you are on desktop) a pop-up dialog is prompted for more info and a description about the specific product. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
